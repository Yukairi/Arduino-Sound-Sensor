Sound Level Meter
This project uses an Arduino to measure sound levels using a microphone and displays the loudness in decibels (dB) on an LCD screen. Depending on the measured sound level, it also controls a buzzer and LED indicators to signify different levels of noise.

-Components-
*Arduino Uno
*Microphone sensor
*LCD display (I2C)
*Buzzer
*LEDs (2x for different sound levels)
*Resistors
*Jumper wires
*Breadboard
-Circuit Diagram-
*Pin Connections
*Microphone Sensor: Connect the analog output to A0 on the Arduino.
*LCD Display: Connect using I2C (SDA to A4, SCL to A5 on the Arduino Uno).
*Buzzer: Connect the positive leg to digital pin 4 and the negative leg to GND.
*LED for Moderate Level: Connect the positive leg to digital pin 5 (use a resistor in series) and the negative leg to GND.
*LED for Loud Level: Connect the positive leg to digital pin 6 (use a resistor in series) and the negative leg to GND.
-Libraries-
*Wire.h for I2C communication.
*LiquidCrystal_I2C.h for the LCD display.

-How It Works-
Setup: The code initializes the sensor, buzzer, LEDs, and the LCD display.
Loop:
It samples the microphone input for a 50 ms window.
Calculates the peak-to-peak amplitude of the sound signal.
Maps the amplitude to a dB value.
Displays the dB value on the LCD.
Based on the dB value, it determines the sound level (Quiet, Moderate, High) and controls the buzzer and LEDs accordingly.

-Usage-
Assemble the components according to the circuit diagram.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
Observe the LCD for loudness readings and the LEDs for level indications.
The buzzer will sound for moderate and high noise levels.

-Troubleshooting-
Ensure all connections are correct and secure.
Verify the I2C address of the LCD display.
Adjust the microphone sensitivity if needed.


This project demonstrates how to build a simple sound level meter with visual and audio indicators, providing a practical introduction to analog signal processing with Arduino.
