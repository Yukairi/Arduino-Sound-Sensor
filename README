Sound Level Meter
This project uses an Arduino to measure sound levels using a microphone and displays the loudness in decibels (dB) on an LCD screen. Depending on the measured sound level, it also controls a buzzer and LED indicators to signify different levels of noise.

Components
Arduino Uno
Microphone sensor
LCD display (I2C)
Buzzer
LEDs (2x for different sound levels)
Resistors
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Circuit Diagram
Pin Connections
Microphone Sensor: Connect the analog output to A0 on the Arduino.
LCD Display: Connect using I2C (SDA to A4, SCL to A5 on the Arduino Uno).
Buzzer: Connect the positive leg to digital pin 4 and the negative leg to GND.
LED for Moderate Level: Connect the positive leg to digital pin 5 (use a resistor in series) and the negative leg to GND.
LED for Loud Level: Connect the positive leg to digital pin 6 (use a resistor in series) and the negative leg to GND.
Libraries
Wire.h for I2C communication.
LiquidCrystal_I2C.h for the LCD display.
